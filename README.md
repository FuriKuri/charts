# Rancher Catalog

A Rancher chart repository differs slightly in directory structure from upstream repos in that it includes an `app version` directory. Though Rancher can use native Helm repositories as well.

A Rancher chart also has two additional files an `app-readme.md` file that provides a high level overview display in the Rancher 2.0 UI and a `questions.yml` file defining questions to prompt the user with.
